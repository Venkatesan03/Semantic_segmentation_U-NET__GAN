U-Net Architecture for Image Segmentation

U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is commonly used for image segmentation. It was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, but it has since been applied to a wide variety of other tasks, including natural image segmentation, remote sensing image segmentation, and medical image analysis.

The U-Net architecture is composed of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is responsible for extracting features from the input image, while the decoder is responsible for generating the segmentation mask.

The encoder consists of a series of convolutional layers that are arranged in a contracting path. The number of filters in each convolutional layer increases as the image is processed down the contracting path. This allows the encoder to learn more complex features from the input image.

The decoder consists of a series of convolutional layers that are arranged in an expanding path. The number of filters in each convolutional layer decreases as the image is processed up the expanding path. This allows the decoder to generate a segmentation mask with the same resolution as the input image.

In addition to the convolutional layers, the U-Net architecture also includes skip connections between the encoder and decoder. These skip connections allow the decoder to access the high-level features that were learned by the encoder. This helps the decoder to generate more accurate segmentation masks.
